HyPED: Hybrid BIPED for Modeling graphical logic games as networks of hybrid automata

* Claims
** Working from OLs yielded this model, which is better than the mechanics first models of other action game makers
** BIPED as-is is not suitable for continuous time/space games, and requires manual abstraction as in Zook's work
** Modeling convenience/safety
*** Sufficiently expressive
*** Avoids certain bugs by construction
*** Admits fast interpretation or compilation to traditional game engine code
***  Relatively straightforward to abstract or simplify automatically, fairly compositional modeling
** Search
*** Shallower trees because of trajectories
*** More "semantic" search over options and timing compared with frame by frame search
*** Dynamics state is just a data structure (valuation) so easy to rewind/replay/bookmark/etc
** Visualization
*** visualize trajectories and upcoming options without simulation
*** visualize objects as state machines, first class representations of object states
** Verification and parameter synthesis
*** adaptation of existing algorithms for model checking (simplified somewhat by more determinism, complicated by disjunctive state invariants)
*** Regular trace grammar, Playspecs are applicable
*** Better representation for learning
* Background
** Biped and other game modeling languages
** Action game makers
*** Have collision and physics logics but not in a rigorous treatment, so hard to analyze
*** Often require manual scripting to get the right physics/space/world models
** OLs
** HAs
* Justification (Analytic)
* Justification (Empirical)
* Other applications
** Idle games
** relaxation of large discrete state spaces
** OL approach generalizes
